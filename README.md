> 3. Press apply, this should come up with a message box stating that the menu has been updated.

## What this software does:
This software allows you to modify the menu on windows which creates new files!
Normally editing this would require a user to go into the windows registry and change some things inside of it.
NME automates that process with an easy to understand UI, and is completely open-source.
Note: This software works on most files but not all.

This is the first winforms application i have wrote as well as the first c# code i have wrote outside of generally learning the syntax of c#, so this code may not be the most efficient but it works. If you feel that there is some way of doing something better, feel free to make a contribution!
